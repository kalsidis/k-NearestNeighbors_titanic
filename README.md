# k-NearestNeighbors_titanic
On this project I create the k-NN model to predict if someone will survive or no in the titanic dataset.
Also I made some graphs where we can see how the values of the merices are changing as the number of nearest neighbors are
encreasing in two options, using the 'age' feature and without using it.
